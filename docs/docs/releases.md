## Release Updates and Versioning

Stay up-to-date with the latest releases of **k3s-simplified** by checking our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/easystartup-io/k3s-simplified/releases).

### Automated Release Pipeline

Our automated pipeline initiates a new release each time changes merge into the main branch, ensuring continuous delivery of improvements.

### Versioning System (CalVer: SemVer Compliant Versioning ðŸ“…)

Our versioning follows the **CalVer** system, aligned with **SemVer** (Semantic Versioning) principles. In our scheme:

- **Major** (SemVer) corresponds to the **Year** (CalVer)
- **Minor** (SemVer) corresponds to the **Month** (CalVer)
- **Patch** (SemVer) corresponds to the **Release Number** within the month (CalVer)

This approach provides a clear, chronological versioning sequence without leading zeros, making it intuitive and compliant with SemVer standards.

#### Example:

- CalVer Format: `YYYY.M.N`
- Example Version: `2024.1.2`
  - Major/Year: `2024`
  - Minor/Month: `1`
  - Patch/Release: `2` (the 2nd release of the month)

This format ensures that each version not only indicates its release time but also its sequence in the overall development process.
