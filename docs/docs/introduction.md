# k3s-simplified: Effortless Kubernetes Clusters on Hetzner Cloud

**k3s-simplified** streamlines Kubernetes deployment in Hetzner Cloud, offering a Java-based open-source alternative to hetzner-k3s. It runs as a standalone binary without dependencies, ensuring ease of maintenance and support. Aimed at production environments, it emphasizes privacy and security, keeping vital components like the API load balancer private.

### Origin & Development

- Originated from [hetzner-k3s](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s).
- Drop in replacement for hetzner-k3s.
- Java port for cross-platform compatibility.
- Active development with a focus on private, isolated clusters for production use.
- Offers full support and paid consultancy services.

### Tool Overview

k3s-simplified is a command-line tool for rapid Kubernetes cluster creation and management in Hetzner Cloud. It leverages k3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution by Rancher, known for its minimal resource consumption and quick deployment.

- **Rapid Deployment**: Set up a fully functional HA k3s cluster with master and worker nodes in 2-3 minutes.
- **Comprehensive Setup**: Includes infrastructure creation (servers, networks, firewalls), k3s deployment, and essential Kubernetes components like Hetzner Cloud Controller Manager, Hetzner CSI Driver, Rancher System Upgrade Controller, and Cluster Autoscaler.
- **Detailed Tutorial**: Check the [getting started](/docs/getting-started) for step-by-step setup instructions.
