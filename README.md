## Project Background

1. This project originated as a fork of [hetzner-k3s](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s).
2. Rewritten in Java for cross-platform compatibility and my familiarity with the language.
3. Actively maintained for production use.
4. I offer full support, including paid consultancy (contact details available [here](https://k3s-simplified.easystartup.io/docs/contact-me)).
5. Emphasis on developing a private, isolated cluster setup, crucial for production environments to safeguard against unauthorized external access.

## About the Tool

A command-line interface (CLI) for effortlessly creating and managing Kubernetes clusters in [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). It utilizes [k3s](https://k3s.io/) by [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) for a lightweight Kubernetes experience.
