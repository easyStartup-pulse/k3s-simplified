# Best simplified way to create a fully functional hetzner kubernetes cluster in production using CLI (command line interface)

### Its a fully open source(MIT LICENSE) drop in replacement to hetzner-k3s written in java, which runs as a single binary, no extra dependency needed

# Full Documentation

Access comprehensive instructions at: **[https://k3s-simplified.easystartup.io](https://k3s-simplified.easystartup.io)**

### Project Background

1. This project originated as a fork of [hetzner-k3s](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s).
2. Rewritten in Java for cross-platform compatibility and my familiarity with the language.
3. Actively maintained for production use.
4. I offer full support, including paid consultancy (contact details available [here](https://k3s-simplified.easystartup.io/contact-me)).
5. Emphasis on developing a private, isolated cluster setup, crucial for production environments to safeguard against unauthorized external access.

## About the Tool

A command-line interface (CLI) for effortlessly creating and managing Kubernetes clusters in [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). It utilizes [k3s](https://k3s.io/) by [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) for a lightweight Kubernetes experience.

## Acknowledgments and shout out to

1. [hetzner-k3s](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s): The inspiration for this project and the basis for expanding my own cluster.
2. [hetznercloud-java](https://github.com/tomsiewert/hetznercloud-java): Essential for cloud API integration. Contributing back to this community project was enriching, especially with the rapid acceptance of my PRs addressing Hetzner API changes.
